# AI and Algorithms Project 2016
### Programming Spies and the Resistance
#### Background
The aim of this project is to implement an artificial intelligence for the game Resistance, a game based on bluffing, deduction and strategy. This project attempts to review the potential avenues for implementing a bot to play this game both convincingly and competitively, especially in competition with other programmed bots.

#### Literature review
Research into potential approaches to AI for the game Resistance specifically has been instigated previously by Daniel Taylor in 2014 [CITATION].

- Summarise the different genres of approaches
  - Expert rules
  - Trust based / suspicion
  - Opponent modelling
  - Statistical analysis

Limitations imposed on learning inbetween games effectively neutralise opponent modelling

- The effect of other bots
