- Unable to save memory state, so unable to learn from behaviours post-game

In “The Resistance” players may have knowledge of the others’ states which we do not. For example, if a Resistance player was on a mission with a single Spy who sabotaged, that Resistance player will know for certain the identity of one spy, but others may not. Modelling such intricacies should be possible, but is quite complicated and requires additional human consideration to design. - pg 21.
