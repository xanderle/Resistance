# Resistance

## Rules:
- As leaders, most agents ensure they select themselves as part of a mission team
- Don't reject the 5th voting attempt for a mission under any circumstances,
otherwise spies win by default
- There is no apparently advantage to player sin either role rejecting the first
voting attempt for the first mission, since no information is known about player roles.
It's recommended subsequent voting attempts for the first mission should also
be approved.
- Several policies for sabotaging when both spies are on the team.
  - Simply don't sabotage
  - sabotage based on who is leader
  - sabotage based on table position index

In a 5 person game, there is no advantage for spies to double sabotage missions
and doing so would aid more advanced bots in narrowing down spy candidates
